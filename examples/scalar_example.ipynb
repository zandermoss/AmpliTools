    "### Compute the 4- and 5-point tree amplitudes of a scalar QFT in arbitrary spacetime dimension with an arbitary spectrum of (massive or massless) states.\n",
    "Given arbitrary (local) interaction operators specified by flavor tensors and polynomials of Mandelstam invariants, AmpliTools\n",
    "1. computes the relevant (tree) diagram topologies,\n",
    "2. constructs their symbolic expressions from Feynman rules,\n",
    "3. reduces these expressions modulo symmetries of the interaction flavor tensors,\n",
    "4. reduces them modulo the on-shell and momentum-conservation constraints, and finally\n",
    "5. expresses the resulting amplitude as a rational function over a minimal kinematic basis with one free flavor index for each external leg.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The amplitudes of particular theories are obtained by substituting explicit expressions for scalar masses and interaction flavor tensors (Wilson coefficients) and fixing the free flavor indices.\n",
    "- However, one can also study general properties of scalar theories with local interactions using the expressions from AmpliTools.\n",
    "- For example, by constructing the leading terms of the Laurent series of the general 4- and 5-point scalar amplitudes and demanding they vanish in the IR (zero-energy) limit, one obtains algebraic constraints on the cubic and quartic interaction flavor tensors which are necessary and sufficient for the theory to exhibit an Adler zero (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13076)."
